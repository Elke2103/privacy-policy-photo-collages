    <h2>Photos Access</h2>
    <p>The app requests access to your photo library to let you select images and to save collages. You can grant limited or full access. If you enable automatic album saving, the app may create or update an album with the name you specify. You can change or revoke photo library access at any time in your device’s Settings.</p>
